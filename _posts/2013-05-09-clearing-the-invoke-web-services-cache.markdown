 I have had problems when working with a custom WSDL, when we change the WSDL Orchestrator "Invoke Web Services" activity does not see the changes. I have come across this multiple times so I thought I would document it. (for my memory if nothing else)
 Thankfully another person has already solved this, inÂ this [blog post][external-blog].
 
 Orchestrator is caching the data returned by the WSDL in;

 C:\ProgramData\Microsoft System Center 2012\Orchestrator\Activities\WebServices2\
 
 So after reading the above article, I performed these steps. 

- Close Runbook Designer
- Delete those newly created DLLs
- Re-Open 'Runbook Designer'

 This worked for me, feel free to post replies about other experiences or solutions as this is a pain. 
 
 Hope this helps.
